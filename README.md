Excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard, "IT Service Desk Analysis," where I’ve analyzed IT service desk operations, ticket resolutions, and agent performance to drive better decision-making.

An organization sought assistance in analyzing ticket trends, usage patterns, system behaviors, and service level agreements. This two-page report highlights key trends, actionable insights, and areas needing improvement.

The dataset consists of two tables—IT Tickets and IT Agents—spanning from 2016 to 2020. It includes 97K tickets raised by 2000 employees and resolved by 50 agents. The report was developed in #PowerBI, with data transformation handled using the Power Query Editor.

🔹 Key Highlights:
✅ Total Tickets: 97,498 (📈 42.5% YoY Growth)
✅ SLA Compliance: 48.2%
✅ Resolution Time (Avg): 4.55 hours
✅ Customer Satisfaction Rate: 4.10/5
✅ Agent Performance & Ticket Distribution
✅ Priority & Problem Category Breakdown

📌 Insights & Impact:
📍 Identified SLA compliance gaps and trends for process improvements
📍 Analyzed agent efficiency to optimize workload distribution
📍 Improved decision-making by categorizing issues & priorities

Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Visualization

This dashboard helps IT support teams enhance efficiency, improve SLAs, and boost customer satisfaction.
